# Fake-News-Detection

The goal of this project is to detect fake news using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In this project, a Bidirectional Neural Network and LSTM based deep learning model detects fake news with high accuracy (99%) from a news corpus. This project can be employed by any media or business firm to automatically predict whether the circulating news is fake or not.
